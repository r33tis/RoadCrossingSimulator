# Road Crossing Simulator

We created a game similar to ''Frogger (1997)''. We did not want to completely recreate it, thus we thought of our own theme. The main character is the epitome of an unpunctual student, who is running across a busy street to make it to university on time. We made the models, animations in Blender and we used Ogre3D as our graphics engine. The game was written in C++.
